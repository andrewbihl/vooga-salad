I spoke with Soravit and he helped me clarify some details about my own design and introduced relevant questions.
We talked about the overall structure, and he pointed out that having one or two top-level model controllers will likely mean that those classes will be large with little function. Going forward, I am going to plan only to add those if there is function to be gained. Instead, our managers for each data object type can implement interfaces. We talked about potential errors as well. From that, we concluded that most foreseeable errors were in invalid values or values not set. To alleviate this, our managers will look for invalid values for any setting methods, and post errors to the view (through an interface) when those are encountered. To avoid incomplete info, our object will be instantiated with default values. A good feature of our design is that the data objects are represented simply at the bottom, so the player can use the same objects as the result from reading the XML files as we willâ€“for them those objects will be properties on larger objects with more functionality. This makes the model modular and avoid repeated code. The communication from the front-end to that back-end is done through a variety of interfaces, and the back-end is bound to the front-end using the Observer/Observable pattern.
